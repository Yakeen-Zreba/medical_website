Most were otherwise healthy adults in their 40s and 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All had MRIs of their heart two to three months after they were diagnosed with the virus, when many seemed to have fully recovered. Those images were compared to people who\'d never had COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of those 100 COVID-19 patients, 78 still had visual signs that the virus had an impact on the heart. Sixty of those patients had signs of ongoing inflammation of the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That\'s really compelling,&quot; Dr. Clyde Yancy, chief of cardiology in the department of medicine at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, told NBC News. &quot;It indicates that months after exposure to COVID-19, we can still detect evidence of a heart that\'s not completely normal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem may not lead to physical symptoms, but could indicate risk for further heart damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once the heart muscle has been injured, there is the potential for progressive injury,&quot; Yancy wrote in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768915?guestAccessKey=bb6fd077-977e-4317-9405-3773b38b2944&amp;amp;utm_source=silverchair&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_alert-jamacardiology&amp;amp;utm_content=olf&amp;amp;utm_term=072720&quot;&gt;editorial &lt;/a&gt;accompanying the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the virus is so new, it\'s not yet known what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/some-covid-19-patients-aren-t-getting-better-major-medical-n1231281&quot;&gt;long-term cardiovascular risks&lt;/a&gt; come with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No pre-existing conditions would have explained the damage, the study authors said, and only a third had been hospitalized with COVID-19. The rest were able to remain at home throughout the course of their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our findings may provide an indication of potentially considerable burden of inflammatory disease in large and growing parts of the population,&quot; the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768914&quot;&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; included 39 autopsies of people who\'d died of COVID-19. Those patients tended to be older, in their 80s. Researchers found evidence of the virus in the heart tissue in 24 of the 39 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What\'s more, five of those patients had signs the virus was actually replicating in the heart tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We know the virus is making its way into the heart muscle, and seems to cause an inflammatory response that we don\'t fully understand yet,&quot; Dr. Matthew Belford, an interventional cardiologist at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said. Belford was not involved in either study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have known for some time that COVID-19 can wreak havoc on the circulatory system, potentially leading to dangerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/doctors-report-uptick-surprising-coronavirus-complication-dangerous-blood-clots-n1190491&quot;&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt;.

Its creators funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research believe it is unique in the range of risk factors it considers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These range from sociodemographic status; exposure to air pollution; lifestyle factors like smoking and drinking alcohol; educational attainment, and even their sense of belonging. Users also detailed their ethnicity, reported stress levels, immigrations status, and whether they have diabetes and high blood pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper detailing how researchers developed the Cardiovascular Disease Population Risk Tool (CVDPoRT) was published in the &lt;i&gt;Canadian Medical Association Journal &lt;/i&gt;on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_heart_disease.htm&quot;&gt;Heart disease&lt;/a&gt; is the leading cause of death in the U.S., killing around 630,000 people a year. The most common form of cardiovascular disease is coronary heart disease, where plaque builds up in the arteries which supply the heart with blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most people don\'t know they have the signs of heart disease until they experience a potentially fatal heart attack, the study authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To develop the test, the researchers assessed data on 104,219 residents from Ontario, who took part in the Canadian Community Health Survey between 2001 to 2007. The age of the participants ranged from 20 to 105 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CVDPoRT was developed with the Canadian population in mind, however it can be adapted to other populations, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/amount-coffee-which-could-protect-heart-revealed-study-990660&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking this much coffee could help keep your heart healthy, study suggests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Doug Manuel, senior scientist at The Ottawa Hospital and lead author of the study, said in a statement: &quot;A lot of people are interested in healthy living, but often we don\'t have that discussion in the doctor\'s office. will check your blood pressure and cholesterol levels, but they don\'t necessarily ask about lifestyle factors that could put you at risk of a heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We hope this tool can help people -- and their care team -- with better information about healthy living and options for reducing their risk of heart attack and stroke.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Main Source :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/online-heart-health-calculator-can-help-predict-risk-dying-cardiovascular-1032247&quot;&gt;https://www.newsweek.com/online-heart-health-calculator-can-help-predict-risk-dying-cardiovascular-1032247&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-05-28 16:02:22'),

(20, 46, 8, 'Specific enzymes protect the human skin and body.', '1622585107_skin1.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;The human body is constantly exposed to various environmental actors, from viruses to bacteria to fungi, but most of these microbial organisms provoke little or no response from our skin, which is charged with monitoring and protecting from external dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, researchers weren\'t quite sure how that happened -- and why our skin wasn\'t constantly alarmed and inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published May 21, 2021 in &lt;i&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/i&gt;, scientists at University of California San Diego School of Medicine identify and describe two enzymes responsible for protecting our skin and body\'s overall health from countless potential microbial intruders. These enzymes, called histone deacetylases (HDACs), inhibit the body\'s inflammatory response in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have figured out why we tolerate certain microbes living on our skin, while the same bacteria would make us very sick if exposed elsewhere in the body,&quot; said Richard Gallo, MD, PhD, Ima Gigli Distinguished Professor of Dermatology and chair of the Department of Dermatology at UC San Diego School of Medicine. &quot;In our research, we identified enzymes that act on the chromosome of specific skin cells that provide immune tolerance by the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Without these enzymes telling our cells to ignore certain bacteria, we\'d have a constant rash on our skin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallo and colleagues say the potential mechanism for how the environment can interact and alter cell function is through epigenetic control of gene expression. Within the skin cells, proteins called toll-like receptors (TLRs) allow the cells to sense their surroundings and potential dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most organs, TLRs act as a warning system that triggers an inflammatory response to threats. But in skin cells, the two identified HDAC enzymes, HDAC8 and HDAC9, inhibit the inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is one of the first demonstrations of how the microbiome can interact with epigenetic factors in the skin and modulate the skin\'s behavior through the inflammatory response. Whatever environment we\'re facing can change a person\'s specific response to it. Since this epigenetic change is reversible, unlike alterations to our DNA, we can potentially control our skin inflammatory response through targeting of these enzymes.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;George Sen, PhD, Associate Professor of Dermatology and Cellular and Molecular Medicine, UC San Diego School of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was initially conducted in mouse models in which HDAC8 and HDAC9 had been genetically knocked out. As a result, the mice\'s skin could not tolerate microbial or viral exposures, resulting in a heightened immune reaction. The team then reproduced the findings with human cells in a culture dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallo said the work could change how doctors treat certain types of skin inflammation or other dermatologic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a completely new way to think about skin immune regulation,&quot; said Gallo. &quot;Through alterations in HDAC activity, we\'ve provided a possible way to explore and quiet down unnecessary inflammation by working with skin cells themselves. In the future, drugs designed to turn these enzymes on or off could help treat skin disease as an alternative to antibiotics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Main Source :&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/superficial-relationship-enzymes-protect-the-skin-by-ignoring-microbes-and-viruses?_ga=2.209882076.854312605.1621667018-1562612558.1616494112&quot;&gt;University of California - San Diego&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210522/Specific-enzymes-protect-the-human-skin-and-body-from-microbes-viruses.aspx&quot;&gt;https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210522/Specific-enzymes-protect-the-human-skin-and-body-from-microbes-viruses.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-05-29 11:06:53'),

All of them are trying to achieve the same thing &ndash; immunity to the virus, and some might also be able to stop transmission. They do so by stimulating an immune response to an antigen, a molecule found on the virus. In the case of COVID-19, the antigen is typically the characteristic spike protein found on the surface of the virus, which it normally uses to help it invade human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE FOUR MAIN TYPES OF COVID-19 VACCINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four categories of vaccines in clinical trials: WHOLE VIRUS, PROTEIN SUBUNIT, VIRAL VECTOR and NUCLEIC ACID (RNA AND DNA). Some of them try to smuggle the antigen into the body, others use the body&rsquo;s own cells to make the viral antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/what-are-whole-virus-vaccines-and-how-could-they-be-used-against-covid-19&quot;&gt;WHOLE VIRUS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many conventional vaccines use whole viruses to trigger an immune response. There are two main approaches. Live attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the virus that can still replicate without causing illness. Inactivated vaccines use viruses whose genetic material has been destroyed so they cannot replicate, but can still trigger an immune response. Both types use well-established technology and pathways for regulatory approval, but live attenuated ones may risk causing disease in people with weak immune systems and often require careful&amp;nbsp;cold storage, making their use more challenging in low-resource countries. Inactivated virus vaccines can be given to people with compromised immune systems but might also need cold storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/what-are-protein-subunit-vaccines-and-how-could-they-be-used-against-covid-19&quot;&gt;PROTEIN SUBUNIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subunit vaccines use pieces of the pathogen - often fragments of protein -&amp;nbsp;to trigger an immune response. Doing so minimises the risk of side effects,&amp;nbsp;but it also means the immune response may be weaker. This is why they often require adjuvants, to help boost the immune response. An example of an existing subunit vaccine is the hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/what-are-nucleic-acid-vaccines-and-how-could-they-be-used-against-covid-19&quot;&gt;NUCLEIC ACID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nucleic acid vaccines use genetic material &ndash; either RNA or DNA &ndash; to provide cells with the instructions to make the antigen. In the case of COVID-19, this is usually the viral spike protein. Once this genetic material gets into human cells, it uses our cells\' protein factories to make the antigen that will trigger an immune response. The advantages of such vaccines are that they are easy to make, and cheap. Since the antigen is produced inside our own cells and in large quantities, the immune reaction should be strong. A downside, however, is that so far, no DNA or RNA vaccines have been licensed for human use, which may cause more hurdles with regulatory approval. In addition, RNA vaccines need to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures, -70C or lower, which could prove challenging for countries that don&rsquo;t have specialised cold storage equipment, particularly low- and middle-income countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/what-are-viral-vector-based-vaccines-and-how-could-they-be-used-against-covid-19&quot;&gt;VIRAL VECTOR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral vector vaccines also work by giving cells genetic instructions to produce antigens. But they differ from nucleic acid vaccines in that they use a harmless virus, different from the one the vaccine is targeting, to deliver these instructions into the cell. One type of virus that has often been used as a vector is adenovirus, which causes the common cold. As with nucleic acid vaccines, our own cellular machinery is hijacked to produce the antigen from those instructions, in order to trigger an immune response. Viral vector vaccines can mimic natural viral infection and should therefore trigger a strong immune response. However, since there is a chance that many people may have already been exposed to the viruses being used as vectors, some may be immune to it, making the vaccine less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Main Source :&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/there-are-four-types-covid-19-vaccines-heres-how-they-work&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/there-are-four-types-covid-19-vaccines-heres-how-they-work&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-05-29 11:00:55'),
(23, 1, 14, 'Can we stop wearing masks after being vaccinated?', '1622414955_masks.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;In some countries, wearing masks against COVID-19 is not mandatory anymore, but can the rest of the world follow suit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced in late April that people who have been fully vaccinated would not need to wear masks anymore in most places, except for high-risk areas such as hospitals, nursing homes and on public transport. This change provides an extra incentive for people in the United States to get vaccinated. A few other countries have already gone mask-free, and it is probably one of the things people are looking forward to in a bid to return to normal, but it may not be the right approach for all countries just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given that children are not yet vaccinated and in many countries young children don&rsquo;t have to wear masks, continuing to enforce mask-wearing even in vaccinated adults may be important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ANTI-MASKERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence showing that measures such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/how-physical-distancing-masks-and-eye-protection-reduces-spread-covid-19&quot;&gt;social distancing and wearing masks are effective in stopping COVID-19 transmission&lt;/a&gt;, not everyone has taken to them with ease, with some countries seeing marches and protests against what the protestors see is an impingement on their freedom and rights, and in some cases a belief that masks are ineffective. Anti-mask protest rallies have happened worldwide, from the United States to France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a new phenomenon, however. For example, a minority of people in San Francisco formed the Anti-Mask League in 1919 in response to mandatory mask-wearing to stop transmission of the &lsquo;Spanish flu&rsquo; &ndash;&amp;nbsp;the deadliest flu outbreak the world has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASK-FREE NATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel was the first country to lift the mandatory face mask rule, when it achieved low rates of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in April. Around 70% of the population has been vaccinated. Bhutan is also mask-free, after vaccinating 90% of its population in just two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHEN CAN WE ALL DITCH THE MASKS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US CDC justified their decision in large part on a study indicating that healthcare workers at St. Jude&rsquo;s Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee who received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine were 75% less likely to have asymptomatic infections. This means that if people have been vaccinated and they are not showing any symptoms of infection, they are much less likely to spread COVID-19 undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it\'s not clear that all other vaccines work equally well at preventing asymptomatic infections, or that any vaccine would do as well against the variant first seen in South Africa, which has not been circulating widely in the United States so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 also seem to affect children more than last year, and given that children are not yet vaccinated and in many countries young children don&rsquo;t have to wear masks, continuing to enforce mask-wearing even in vaccinated adults may be important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it may be easier in many areas to lift mask restrictions for everyone or no-one depending on levels of vaccination and COVID-19 risk in a population, because of the challenges in confirming whether or not someone not wearing a mask has actually been vaccinated or if they are just bored of wearing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Main Source :&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/can-we-stop-wearing-masks-after-being-vaccinated&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/can-we-stop-wearing-masks-after-being-vaccinated&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-05-30 12:00:00'),

In addition, it uncovered that skin from eczema and psoriasis patients share many of the same molecular pathways as developing skin cells, offering potential new drug targets for treating these painful skin diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is published in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the paper, &ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6527/eaba6500.abstract&quot;&gt;Developmental cell programs are co-opted in inflammatory skin disease.&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our skin acts as a barrier, protecting us against invading bacteria or viruses, and is vital for health. Inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic eczema and psoriasis are chronic conditions, where the immune system becomes overactive, causing itchy or flaky skin that can be very painful and prone to infection. These conditions can have significant impact on people&rsquo;s lives, but the trigger is unknown and there is no cure, with treatments only helping to relieve the symptoms, not the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the global Human Cell Atlas effort to map every cell type in the human body, the new comprehensive atlas of developing and adult skin is a valuable resource for scientists worldwide. It could also provide a template for regenerative medicine, helping researchers grow skin in the laboratory more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin is a complex tissue made up of many different types of cells. To learn how skin forms and how this relates to adult health and disease, the researchers studied cells from developing skin, comparing these with biopsies from healthy adults, and eczema and psoriasis patients. Using single-cell technology and machine learning, the team analyzed more than half a million individual skin cells, to see exactly which genes were switched on in each cell. This allowed them to find out what each individual cell does and how the cells talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;There have been decades of research on skin cells grown in the laboratory,&rdquo; noted Fiona Watt, PhD, professor at Kings College London. She continued: &ldquo;However, it is not always clear how the properties of the cells change in the laboratory setting. By revealing the detailed make-up of cells immediately on isolation from developing and adult human skin, this Skin Cell Atlas can act as a template for researchers trying to reconstruct healthy skin in regenerative medicine. Our data is openly available, and we hope this will aid research into creating skin tissue in the laboratory.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To their surprise, the researchers discovered that the diseased skin cells shared many of the same cellular mechanisms as developing cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muzlifah Haniffa, MD, PhD, professor at Newcastle University and associate faculty at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: &ldquo;This Skin Cell Atlas reveals specific molecular signals sent by healthy developing skin to summon immune cells and form a protective layer. We were amazed to see that eczema and psoriasis skin cells were sending the same molecular signals, which could over activate immune cells and cause the disease. This had never been seen before. Discovering that developing cell pathways re-emerge is a huge leap in our understanding of inflammatory skin disease and offers new routes for finding treatments.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also provides a completely new understanding of inflammatory disease, opening up new avenues for research on other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Reynolds, MBBS, PhD, clinical research fellow at Newcastle University and a first author on the study, said: &ldquo;While our study focused on inflammatory skin disease, there is potential that other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease could be triggered in the same way. This research shows the importance of studying development and could open up entirely new avenues for inflammatory disease research.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study uncovered how healthy skin tissue develops and revealed the cells that are present in adult skin. This has great implications for regenerative medicine, especially for burn victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Part of the international Human Cell Atlas initiative to create a &lsquo;Google map&rsquo; of the human body,&rdquo; noted Sarah Teichmann, PhD, co-senior author from the Wellcome Sanger Institute and University of Cambridge, and co-chair of the Human Cell Atlas initiative. &ldquo;This Skin Cell Atlas study,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;reveals that studying development can not only help understand how tissues are formed in the first place, but also shed vital light on diseases. This map reveals a completely new way of thinking about inflammatory diseases, and is an important reference that other scientists can use to investigate the causes of disease, and inform potential new treatments.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2021-06-01 23:55:43');
